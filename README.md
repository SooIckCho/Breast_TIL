# Breast_TIL
R code and raw data for Deep learning-based tissue analyzer reduces discrepancy in tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte evaluation in breast cancer with better prediction of therapeutic response

The pathologistsâ€™ evaluation results and the inference results of the DL-powered model on 171 grids and 48 WSIs from TCGA can be accessed from the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVdRHpjGDMWE3n_TH07ZiG8nzA-w9YZt/view?usp=share_link.
